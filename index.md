# Lesson 1 : Essentiality and Classification of Nutrients

## Taken  from this source: [[Mineral Nutrition of Plants.pdf#page=9-11]]

### Nutrient Sources for Plants
> Almost all of the nutrients needed by plants is sourced out in the soil. Soil acts as storage and delivery system by nutrients for plants.

### Elements that are Nutrients
🧐 The criteria for an element to qualify as a nutrient was established by Arnon and Stout; it states that
>  1. A given plant must be unable to complete its lifecycle in the absence of the element
>  2. The function of the element must not be replaceable by another element
>  3. The element must be directly involved in plant metabolism

### Behavior of nutrients in Plants
This can be group into 4.  Primarily taken up by the plants in ionic (charge) form.

#### Group 1
> - Major constituents of organic material. 
> - Essential elements of atomic groups involved in enzymatic processes. 
> - Assimilation by oxidation-reduction reactions

> Forms taken up
> - {CO_2}, $HCO^-_3$, $H_2O$, $O_2$, $NO^-_2$, $NH^+_4$, $N_2$, $SO^{2-}_4$, $SO_2$ ions from the soil solution, gases, from the atmosphere

#### Group 2
> - Esterification with alcohol groups. 
> - Phosphate esters involved in energy transfer reactions.

> Forms taken up
> - $PO^-_4$, Boric acid, Borate, Silic acid form the soil solution

#### Group 3
> - Non-specific functions establishing osmotic potential. 
> - More specific for optimal confimation of enzymes (enzymes activation). 
> - Bridging of reaction partners. 
> - Balancing of reaction partners.
> - Balancing anions.
> - Controlling membrane permeability and electrochemical potentials.

#### Group 4
> - In chelated form in prosthetic groups of enzymes.
> - Enable electron transport by valency change
