### History of Mulder's Chart
> Around the middle of the 20th century, Mr D. Mulder was the first to make a link between all sorts of soil minerals and their interactions. He recorded those in the so-called Soil Mineral Wheel. The wheel is a simple representation of which minerals go well together, the synergists that enhance each other. It also shows the minerals that do not go well together, the antagonists that counteract each other. 
### Antagonism
> Decrease in availability to the plant of a nutrient by the action of another nutrient
### Stimulation 
> An increase in the need for a nutrient by the plant because of the increase in the level of another nutrient
